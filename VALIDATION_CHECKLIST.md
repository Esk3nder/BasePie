# BasePie MVP - KeeperGate Implementation Validation Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Validation

### üîß Build & Compilation
```bash
# Install dependencies (if needed)
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup

# Build all contracts
forge build

# Expected: Successful compilation with no errors
```

### üß™ Test Suite
```bash
# Run all tests
forge test

# Run specific KeeperGate tests with verbosity
forge test --match-contract KeeperGateTest -vvv

# Run with gas reporting
forge test --gas-report

# Expected: All tests pass, especially:
# ‚úÖ testOpenWindow_Success
# ‚úÖ testOpenWindow_RevertsTooEarly  
# ‚úÖ testOpenWindow_RevertsTooLate
# ‚úÖ testOpenWindow_RevertsDoubleExecution
# ‚úÖ testOpenWindow_AnyoneCanExecuteAfterGrace
# ‚úÖ testOpenWindow_RevertsWhenPaused
# ‚úÖ testSetGracePeriod_OnlyGovernor
# ‚úÖ testFuzz_WindowTimingBoundaries
```

### üìù Static Analysis
```bash
# Run slither for security analysis (if installed)
slither contracts/KeeperGate.sol --print human-summary

# Check for common issues
forge inspect KeeperGate storage-layout
forge inspect KeeperGate abi
```

### üîç Coverage Check
```bash
# Generate coverage report
forge coverage --contracts contracts/KeeperGate.sol

# Expected: >90% coverage for KeeperGate
```

## Deployment Validation

### üöÄ Deploy to Testnet
```bash
# Set environment variables
export PRIVATE_KEY="your_deployer_private_key"
export RPC_URL_BASE_SEPOLIA="https://sepolia.base.org"

# Deploy to Base Sepolia
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL_BASE_SEPOLIA \
  --broadcast \
  --verify \
  -vvvv

# Expected outputs:
# ‚úÖ OracleModule deployed
# ‚úÖ TradeAdapter deployed
# ‚úÖ BatchRebalancer deployed
# ‚úÖ PieVault implementation deployed
# ‚úÖ PieFactory deployed
# ‚úÖ KeeperGate deployed
# ‚úÖ Deployment verification successful!
```

### üîê Post-Deployment Verification
```bash
# Verify contracts on Basescan
forge verify-contract <KEEPER_GATE_ADDRESS> \
  contracts/KeeperGate.sol:KeeperGate \
  --chain base-sepolia

# Check role assignments
cast call <KEEPER_GATE_ADDRESS> \
  "hasRole(bytes32,address)" \
  $(cast keccak "KEEPER") <KEEPER_ADDRESS> \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL_BASE_SEPOLIA
```

## Integration Testing

### üîÑ End-to-End Window Processing
1. Create a test pie via PieFactory
2. Wait for window time (or warp in test)
3. Call `keeperGate.openWindow(pieAddress)` as keeper
4. Verify `lastProcessedWindow` updated
5. Verify rebalancer was called
6. Attempt double execution (should fail)

### ‚è∞ Grace Period Testing
1. Wait for window time + grace period
2. Call `openWindow` as non-keeper address
3. Verify successful execution

### üõë Emergency Pause Testing
1. Call `pause()` as governor
2. Attempt `openWindow` (should revert)
3. Call `unpause()` as governor
4. Verify normal operation restored

## Security Checklist

- [x] No reentrancy vulnerabilities (ReentrancyGuard used)
- [x] Access control properly configured (roles checked)
- [x] Integer overflow protection (uint40 bounds check)
- [x] External call safety (check-effects-interactions)
- [x] Pausable for emergency situations
- [x] Idempotent window processing
- [x] No unbounded loops
- [x] Events emitted for all state changes

## Gas Optimization Check

Expected gas costs:
- `openWindow`: ~150,000 gas (including rebalancer call)
- `setGracePeriod`: ~30,000 gas
- `pause/unpause`: ~25,000 gas

## Final Validation

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Deployment successful on testnet
- [ ] Contracts verified on block explorer
- [ ] Roles properly configured
- [ ] Integration test with actual PieVault successful
- [ ] Gas costs within acceptable range
- [ ] No critical security issues found

# PR: Frontend Test Environment Scaffolding for Pies/Slices UX

## What
Created comprehensive scaffolding for a mock test environment that enables UX testing of the BasePie pies/slices interface without blockchain dependencies.

## Why
- Enable rapid UI/UX iteration without contract deployment
- Allow testing of edge cases and error scenarios
- Provide foundation for comprehensive frontend development
- Support parallel development while contracts are being refined

## Changes
### Added (19 files)
- **Mock Infrastructure**: Data types, generators, contracts, and hooks
- **Component Scaffolds**: PieChart, AllocationTable, PieCard, WeightSlider
- **Page Scaffolds**: Pies listing, detail, builder, and portfolio pages
- **Test Suite**: Unit and integration tests with 11 passing tests

### Modified (3 files)
- `components/Providers.tsx` - Added MockProvider integration
- `app/page.tsx` - Updated landing page scaffold
- `package.json` - Added test scripts and dependencies

## Testing
- ✅ 11/11 tests passing
- ✅ Data generators producing valid structures
- ✅ Weight normalization working correctly (sum to 10000 bps)
- ✅ Mock contracts with in-memory store operational

## Risks
- **Low Risk**: Scaffolding only, no production code affected
- **Lint Warnings**: 43 expected warnings from stub implementations
- **Build Status**: Will fail due to lint errors until full implementation

## Reviewer Checklist
- [ ] Review architecture in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- [ ] Check test coverage is adequate
- [ ] Verify mock data structures match contract interfaces
- [ ] Confirm separation between mock and real modes
- [ ] Validate that existing functionality is not broken

## Next Steps
1. Complete UI component implementations
2. Implement all mock hooks
3. Build out full page functionality
4. Add interactive dev tools panel

## Documentation
- See `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for detailed architecture
- Run `npm test` to verify all tests pass
- Use `npm run dev:mock` to start with mocks enabled

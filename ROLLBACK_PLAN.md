# KeeperGate Implementation - Rollback Plan

## Immediate Rollback Procedure

### 1. Emergency Pause (< 1 minute)
If issues are detected post-deployment, immediately pause the KeeperGate:

```bash
# As governor, pause KeeperGate operations
cast send <KEEPER_GATE_ADDRESS> \
  "pause()" \
  --private-key $GOVERNOR_PRIVATE_KEY \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

This prevents any window processing while investigating issues.

### 2. Git Rollback (Development)
```bash
# Save current work
git stash

# Revert to commit before KeeperGate implementation
git revert HEAD~1

# Or reset to specific commit (use with caution)
git reset --hard <commit-before-keepergate>
```

### 3. Contract Rollback Options

#### Option A: Disable via Pause (Recommended)
- Keep KeeperGate paused indefinitely
- Windows can still be triggered manually via direct BatchRebalancer calls
- No code changes required

#### Option B: Deploy New Contracts
```bash
# Deploy new versions without KeeperGate dependency
forge script script/Deploy_NoKeeper.s.sol \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL \
  --broadcast
```

#### Option C: Upgrade Pattern (if upgradeable)
- Deploy new implementation without keeper dependency
- Upgrade proxy to point to new implementation

## Rollback Triggers

Initiate rollback if any of these conditions occur:

1. **Critical Security Issue**
   - Unauthorized window execution
   - Funds at risk
   - Reentrancy detected

2. **Functional Failures**
   - Windows not processing at scheduled times
   - Double execution occurring
   - Grace period not functioning

3. **Integration Issues**
   - BatchRebalancer calls failing
   - PieVault state corruption
   - Role permission errors

## Recovery Steps

### Phase 1: Stabilize (0-15 minutes)
1. Pause KeeperGate
2. Alert team via emergency channels
3. Document issue with timestamps
4. Check for affected pies/users

### Phase 2: Diagnose (15-60 minutes)
1. Review transaction logs
2. Check event emissions
3. Verify state variables
4. Test isolated components

### Phase 3: Fix or Rollback (1-4 hours)
1. If fixable: Deploy patch
2. If not fixable: Execute full rollback
3. Update documentation
4. Notify stakeholders

## Manual Window Processing (Fallback)

While KeeperGate is disabled, process windows manually:

```bash
# Direct call to BatchRebalancer
cast send <BATCH_REBALANCER_ADDRESS> \
  "processWindow(address)" \
  <PIE_VAULT_ADDRESS> \
  --private-key $ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

## Monitoring During Rollback

Monitor these metrics:
- Gas usage spikes
- Failed transactions
- Event emissions
- User complaints
- TVL changes

## Post-Rollback Actions

1. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Document what went wrong
   - Create test cases for the issue
   - Update deployment procedures

2. **Communication**
   - Notify users of status
   - Update documentation
   - Post-mortem report

3. **Prevention**
   - Add missing tests
   - Improve monitoring
   - Update validation checklist

## Rollback Testing

Before production deployment, test rollback procedures:

```bash
# Deploy to testnet
./deploy_testnet.sh

# Simulate failure
./simulate_failure.sh

# Execute rollback
./rollback_testnet.sh

# Verify system stability
./verify_rollback.sh
```

## Recovery Time Objectives

- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: 15 minutes for pause, 4 hours for full rollback
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: No data loss expected (blockchain immutability)

## Approval Requirements

Rollback must be approved by:
- [ ] Technical Lead
- [ ] Security Officer
- [ ] At least one Governor role holder

## Rollback Completion Checklist

- [ ] System stabilized
- [ ] Issue documented
- [ ] Users notified
- [ ] Manual processing available
- [ ] Post-mortem scheduled
- [ ] Preventive measures identified
